* Advanced machine learning; 2025 - present  
    * This course rely heavily on NVIDIA Teaching Kit materials, therefore I don't want to share the slides online.
* Deep learning and machine learning in sciences; 2025 - present
* Modern physics laboratory; 2024
  
Note: Slide style are combined with NVIDA teaching kit material, which I am allowed to do in theory. Or at least I was informed that way.

For Physics PhD Stuendts in the Eötvös University, I have created an exam preparation material for complex exam.
