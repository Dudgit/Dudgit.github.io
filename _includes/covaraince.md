To understand covoriance let's break down the equation $$\Sigma_{ij} = E[(X_i-\mu_i)(X_j-\mu_j)]$$. Here the 2 index $$i,j$$ will represent which feature we will be taking into consideration. To have an example, we measured some economical characteristics of a country, let's say 10 values for 55 country. The number of features we have (10) will determine the size of our matrix, where every row number indicate the number of feature we compare and the column number will indicate what we compare it to. If we check $$i = 3, j=5$$ element of the matrix it will give us the covariance of feature 3 to feature 5. The $$\mu_i$$ is the mean of that specific feature and the $$E[...]$$ note that we want to calculate the mean of this expression. Since $$X_i$$ will be a vector of 55 elements for every feature, we wan to average this out. Okay what is the meaning of covariance then? If your features are standardized, like in PCA, the end result will be their correlation. Correlation explains us how strongly features effects each other. If the correlation is big in between 2 values one can indicate the other. Like what you can see in this figure:

*Fig 1: House prices based on their sizes. This is just an illustration, it has nothing to do with the real prices, it's just here to explain correlation.*

The bigger the correlation in between the features the stronger this relation is. If the correlation is small to zero it means that the values can't be expressed with each other or they don't indicate any kind of relation. Correlation can be negative but its very much the same as it's positive version. The only difference is that if it's negative they always go to opposite direction. If one feature is getting smaller the other one is getting bigger.
