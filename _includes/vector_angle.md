This is a super basic math concept people learn in their ealry studies. Yet we will see that this will lead many-many great deep learning concept. If you need a reminder the angle between 2 vectors can be calculated as: $$\textbf{v_1} \cdot \textbf{v_2} = |v_1| |v_2| cos(\theta) $$, where $$\theta $$ is the angle between the 2 vectors. Okay, we know this, but why does this help us? If we want to check the similarity of 2 matricies we just have to check what is the result of their dot product, the closer they are to each other (smaller the angle) the higher their dot product will be.
