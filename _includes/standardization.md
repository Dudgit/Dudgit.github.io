Standardize mean that we subtract the mean of a feature from every element of it and dived it with it's standard deviation. $$X_i = \frac{X_i -\mu_i}{\sigma_i}$$, where $$i$$ is the index of the features. What it does it will make the mean of our data 0 while it's deviation to 1. If you substract a number from all other data point the new mean will be smaller with that number, therefore if you use the original mean you will end up with a new dataset having 0 mean. Same logic applies to the standard devaiation and we arrive to the equation.
