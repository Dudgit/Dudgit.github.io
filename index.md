Welcome here dear reader! If you ended up here it means you are interested in the world of deep learning, but you don't know where to start.
In this blog I will try to explain different machine learning and deep learning topics to you. No matter if you are university or a high school student or you just interested in the topic.

# Motivation
During my years of study I always had to face a problem that I suppose might be true to you too. I don't understand mathemarics. It was especially akward as a physicist because withouth math, it's hard to understand the phenomenas. If you are like me that you need some real life example something that "make sense", you are in the right place. As I started to teach machine learning and deep learning I always had to face the issue of how much math should I put into it. The correct answer is always as much as possible. But when my students or I have to approach a new field of study with a plenty of special expression and mathematical rules I usually just get lost. There are notations that might be unfamiliar for you, or ideas that are hard to follow if you are not working in that area. My goal here is not to exclude math, but to explain it as much as possible (for me at least).

# About me
I'm a physics PhD student from Hungary. But wait, then why am I writing about deep learning? Actually I started to work with machine learning for my master thesis and ever since I'm doing my research in this area. TODO: add some more info about me later.
